historic sites beijing you be ok chose have breakfast the hotel was really tasty was good selection dishes are couple computers use the communal area well pool table there also small swimming pool gym area would definitely stay this hotel but only if did not plan travel central beijing it take long time the location is ok if you plan to do lot of shopping there is big shopping centre few minutes

expecting we found reception staff generally helpful friendly aren fastest the world it unreasonable all the hotel manager made an effort speak us times was extremely helpful welcoming breakfast buffet was quite good reasonably priced are number good restaurants the four points sheraton next door lots options is massive mall about block away that has dining options well the only issue we ran

two bad experiences taxi drivers charged us times the proper price the journey stuck public transport found it really easy people mentioned that the bamboo garden hard beds be honest actually found softer lot of the hotels stayed in china dont seem be many travel websites you book rooms this hotel we booked just emailing thru the address on their website standard policy most chinese hotels completely ignore email enquiries receive found the bamboo garden respond enquiries really quickly their office hours go back beijing definately stay the bamboo garden oct lots character nice location

bedroom large somewhat hard bed new tv unit bedroom faced front alley quiet bathroom small functional clean were issues bother your response may vary front room kind place want sit relax furniture little severe some plaster walls near bathroom little soft showing signs moisture damage hard bed would been concern stayed longer took sleeping pills first nights help get jet lag really notice best aspect hotel its location beijing hutong north side city minute walk south the geeting subway station alley the main street old style courtyard building some rooms newer looking building the inner courtyard see since is star hotel the prices breakfast internet access laundry etc not unreasonable the location means lots options ate several times dumpling place down the alley the hotel they have an english menu probably they used tourists the hotel eating mostly saw chinese eating there is youth hostel minute walk south the main street has yuan per hour internet access relatively inexpensive tours offer another minutes south is the houhai lake area loads restaurants bars few historic sights had delightful day walking around the hutongs lakes on the north side beijing is relatively easy get the summer palace great wall taxis are cheap but traffic make difficult times reach areas so usually took the subway get close then taxi the rest of the way return beijing tourist would stay again
