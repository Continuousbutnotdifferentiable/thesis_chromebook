[4, 4, -1, -1, 2]
 
not
 
too
 
[-6, -8, 0, 4, -5]
. 
I
 
[-1, 10, 6, 4, -2]
 
in
 
this
 
[3, -6, -5, -7, 5]
 
for
 
one
 
[-4, -5, 2, 1, -1]

As
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
[7, 2, -6, 2, 1]
 
[-2, 2, 6, 7, -3]
 
[0, 1, -3, -10, 3]

Once
 
I
 
have

[-1, 5, 3, -1, -1]
 
at
 
the
 
[8, 7, -3, -1, 2]

I
 
was
 
very
 
[-4, 0, -2, 5, -8]
 
[0, -2, 1, 0, 2]
 
with
 
the

[0, -1, 5, 6, 1]
 
[-2, 0, 1, 7, -5]
 
[6, 4, -4, -12, 7]
. 
It
 
was
 
very
 
[-1, 5, -4, 1, -7]
 
and
 
[3, 0, 0, 3, 1]
. 
I
 
found
 
the
 
[-15, -12, 4, -7, 0]

[1, 7, -2, -4, -2]
 
[4, -1, 1, 5, 2]

a

out
 
of

but
 
I
 
[-3, -6, -1, 2, -2]
 
they
 
are
 
[2, 1, -2, -2, 1]
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
the
 
[1, 0, -1, 0, 0]
 
[0, 1, 1, 3, -1]
.
As
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
[-8, 3, 3, -2, -5, 0]
 
[6, -3, -1, -1, 7, 0]
 
[-4, -5, -1, 0, -3, 0]

I
 
was
 
[5, 0, 1, 6, 1]
 
a

[-7, -3, 2, -13, 5]
 
upon

[-7, -1, 5, 5, -4]
 
in

It
 
was
 
only
 
a
 
[9, 3, -2, 2, 4]
 
of
 
[6, -8, -10, 2, 0]
 
[-5, 7, 7, -1, -3]
 
in
 
a
 
[-3, -1, 0, -8, 3]
 
[2, -4, -2, 8, -3]
, 
but
 
nevertheless
 
a
 
[5, 9, 0, 0, 0]
 
[-9, -4, 0, -4, -3]

My
 
[4, 0, 2, 10, -1]
 
was
 
[5, 4, -2, -6, 4]
 
and
 
[1, 1, -1, 6, -3]

[0, 8, 3, 5, -6]
 
in
 
each
 
[-5, -1, 4, 8, -5]
 
and
 
you
 
get
 
two
 
[-1, -4, -4, -14, 7]
 
[2, -6, -1, 5, 1]
 
of
 
[3, 0, 1, 5, 1]

The

It
 
is
 
at
 
the
 
last

and
 
you
 
then
 
[-1, -1, -7, 1, -8]
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
[-5, -1, 9, -8, 9]

if
 
you

then
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
[1, -5, -7, 1, -3]

I
 
[-4, 4, 7, -1, 1]
 
to
 
have
 
some
 
[5, -8, -11, -8, 4]
 
in
 
the

which
 
was
 
really
 
[4, -5, -9, -10, 6]

there
 
was
 
a

There
 
are
 
a

as
 
well
 
as
 
a

[0, -1, 2, 1, 2]
 
and
 
a
 
[-2, 0, -3, -5, -3]
 
[1, 3, 4, 4, 1]

I
 
would

as
 
it
 
can
 
take
 
a

The
