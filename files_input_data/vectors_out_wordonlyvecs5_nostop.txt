not
 
too
 
[-3, 1, 3, 3, -2]

I
 
[-4, 11, 9, 7, -4]
 
in
 
this

one

As
 
this

[0, 5, 3, 0, 1]

Once

at
 
the

It
 
was
 
very
 
[6, 6, -4, 3, -1]
 
and
 
[9, 6, -4, 6, 0]
. 
I
 
found
 
the

keep
 
up
 
the

As
 
I
 
have
 
a

It

but
 
nevertheless
 
a

My

you
 
then
 
[-1, -2, 1, 1, 1]

I
 
[-4, 6, 7, -1, 1]
